# Lab Assignment 8
## Creating a Final Mix: Automation and Effects

---
#### Objectives:
  * Practice with automating effects parameters
  * Practice with applying effects
  * Practice with using a limiter
---

1. Add at least two effects plugins discussed in class to the tracks of your choosing. Be thoughtful about the effects you add and think about how they will contribute to the overall mix.

2. Add at least one instance of automation to a parameter of a plugin that you have used so far. This may be either on the effects you have just added or on plugins used in the previous two labs. You may either apply this automation directly to the track or on a separate automation track.

3. Now we are ready to add the finishing touches! Apply a limiter to the master and set the ceiling to approximately -3dB. Raise the master fader until the limiter just barely kicks on (This will help to glue everything together). If your master is clipping substantially, bring the fader down before applying the limiter or go back and adjust the balance of the tracks.

4. When you are finished, submit your project using the procedure in the [Basic Submission Instructions](../DAW-instructions/basic-submission-instructions.md#submitting-a-song) document.

5. As always, save a backup copy on your personal storage media.
