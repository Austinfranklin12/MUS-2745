# Lab Assignment 7
## Creating a Final Mix: EQ and Space
---
#### Objectives:
  * Practice with Eq (boosting and attenuating)
  * Practice with panning instruments in a stereo field
  * Practice with applying reverb and compression
---
Use the sample project files from lab 6 to complete this assignment. Please ensure that your song/project is updated with the title "YourFirstNameYourLastName-Lab7".

1. The cymbals on the drum track are a little too quiet. Without adjusting the overall drum track volume, add the Pro EQ plugin to the track. Set the cutoff for the high shelf filter somewhere between 2-5kHz. Then use the gain knob on the filter to boost these frequencies until you achieve a desirable sound.  

2. The vocal's eq needs to be adjusted because there is a very obvious ringing sound. Add the Pro Eq plugin and look at the spectrum property which plays the graphic as the sound is coming through. You should see a peaking section somewhere around the middle of the section. Pull that frequency out to clean up the overall sound.

3. Pan the drums, bass, and guitar to achieve a desirable sound. Since you have limited instruments to work with, panning to <100> on either side might create too much space. I would recommend this as a starting place:
* Drums - Left 15
* Bass - Left 15
* Guitar - Right 50

Let your ears be your guide!
 
4. Add one instance of reverb and delay to the tracks of your choosing. The goal is to fill in the space between the instruments to help make the mix sound FULL. Do not over-saturate, less is more! Make sure to add the plugin to the sub-mix you created for the bass and guitar if you want to use these instruments.
 
5. When you are finished, submit your project using the procedure in the Basic Submission Instructions document.

6. As always, save a backup copy on your personal storage media. You will use the same files for lab 8!
