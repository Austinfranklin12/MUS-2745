#### Instructions
1. Open your DAW, create a new song/project with the title "YourFirstNameYourLastName-Lab1". If prompted, use the following settings:
  * Sample Rate - 44.1kHz
  * Resolution - 16 bit
  * Tempo - 120 BPM
2. Drag 3 or more loops onto new separate tracks in the arrange window. Try to pick loops that combine well together to make an interesting beat/song. 
3. Using only the basic editing/splicing techniques - copying, reversing, and speed/pitch manipulations - create 2 different variations of the original combined "beat", each on their own tracks, each at least 4 bars/measures in length. Name the tracks of the variations "V1_Instrument, V2_Instrument" so that it is clear which ones are finished. You should have at least 9 tracks in total, 3 originals and 6 variations.
4. Ensure that all of your edits are snapped to [The Grid](../DAW-instructions/the-grid.md). When grid snapping is on, by default, regions and edits will snap to rhythmic divisions as you drag in the arrange window. To temporarily disable this behavior – e.g. if you need to make a tighter edit on an individual audio region – hold the shift key while dragging. If you notice the opposite behavior - that snapping only occurs while holding shift – simply press the N key to re-enable **Snap to Grid**.
5. When you are finished, submit your project using the procedure in the [Basic Submission Instructions](../DAW-instructions/basic-submission-instructions.md) document.
6. As always, save a backup copy on your personal storage media.
