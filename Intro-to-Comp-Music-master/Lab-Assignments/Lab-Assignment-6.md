  * Practice with compression
---

A sample project has been made to use with this lab and is on Moodle. Please ensure that your song/project has the title "YourFirstNameYourLastName-Lab6".

1. You will see 4 tracks: Drums, Bass, Guitar, and Vocals. The bass and guitar's volume needs to be adjusted, do so with the mix tool.

2. Create a submix containg two or more instruments that make sense to be grouped together (Hint: bass and guitar).
*A submix is created when the output of multiple channels are sent to a bus track rather than the main outs.*

3. Once you have a submix set up, apply a compressor on the bus channel. Adjust the attack, release, ratio, and threshold to attain a desirable sound.

4. The drums need to be glued together with compression. Add a compressor and adjust the attack, release, ratio, and threshold to attain a desirable sound.

5. When you are finished, submit your project using the procedure in the [Basic Submission Instructions](../DAW-instructions/basic-submission-instructions.md#submitting-a-song) document.

6. As always, save a backup copy on your personal storage media. You will use the same files for lab 7!
