# Lab Assignment 8
## Plugins and Advanced Mixing

---

#### Objectives:
  * Practice with Plugins as inserts
  * Practice with routing and use of plugins on a submix/bus
  * Practice with routing and use of plugins on an aux send

---

A sample project has been made to use with this lab and is on Moodle. Please ensure that your song/project has the title "YourFirstNameYourLastName-Lab8".
# VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY IMPORTANT-WHEN YOU DOWNLOAD THE PROJECT OPEN IT IN STUDIO ONE AND PRESS > SAVE AS "YourFirstNameYourLastName-Lab8" OTHERWISE IT WONT SAVE WITH YOUR NAME

1. You will see 4 tracks: Drums, Bass, Guitar, and Vocals. Each of these tracks need to be manipulated in some way and the plugin to do so is already loaded on each track. The drums need to be glued together with compression. Using the compressor provided, adjust the attack, release, ratio, and threshold to attain a desirable drum sound.

2. The bass's volume needs to be adjusted, do so with the mix tool.

3. The guitar's volume needs to be adjusted, do so with the mix tool.

4. The vocal's eq needs to be adjusted because there is a very obvious ringing sound. Open the Eq plugin and look at the spectrum property which plays the graphic as the sound is coming through. You should see a peaking section somewhere around the middle of the section. Pull that frequency out to clean up the overall sound.

5. Create a submix containg two or more instruments that make sense to be grouped together.
*A submix is created when the output of multiple channels are sent to a bus track rather than the main outs.*
Once you have a submix set up, apply a plugin on the bus channel appropriate for this signal flow - e.g. EQ, compression, etc.

6. Create an aux send = Provide at least one example of one or more tracks sent to a bus or FX channel using aux sends. Apply a plugin to the bus/FX channel appropriate for this type of signal flow - e.g. reverb, delay, etc.

7. When you are finished, submit your project using the procedure in the [Basic Submission Instructions](../DAW-instructions/basic-submission-instructions.md#submitting-a-song) document.

8. As always, save a backup copy on your personal storage media.
